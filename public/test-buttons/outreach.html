<b>CUSAP section from Brandon in Santa Cruz:</b><br>
"I've been/Brandon Bunt from CUSAP has been working at the Barbara Ford Center for Peace in Santa Cruz del Quiche, Guatemala to better understand the reality of local subsistence farming, and improve local quality of life by examining waste management practices and studying problems farmers face with their crops. Challenges in the region include reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, lack of waste disposal facilities, low soil health, and deforestation. Biochar was identified as a potential solution that would simultaneously offer solutions for reducing organic waste, improving forest management, providing organic soil amendment and thus increasing soil health, and diminishing the need for chemical fertilizer. By installing a small-scale 30-gallon capacity biochar reactor at the center, the reactor will produce enough biochar for use on the center's crops and produce excess for a profit after 6 months. The center can then sell biochar to local farmers, as well as educate them on how to create their own biochar set-ups. This campaign to adopt biochar will hopefully increase the autonomy of local communities by lowering reliance on expensive garbage disposal services and chemical fertilizers."<br><br>
