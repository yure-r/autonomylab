The Autonomy of “Smart” Cities is a cross-disciplinary course that is dedicated to finding technology-based solutions to some of the most pressing issues that are currently facing our cities.<br> 
This course will focus on closed-loop systems in order to explore a more sustainable transportation, energy, and urban agricultural structures that promote the autonomy of our communities and enhance the livability of our cities.<br><br>Students will be expected to develop complete solutions (design and implementation) integrating ideas and concepts from different disciplines such as:<br><ul>
<li>Design</li>
<li>ML</li>
<li>Robotics</li>
<li>IoT</li>
<li>Hardware design</li>
<li>Vision</li>
<li>Lighting</li>
<li>Control theory</li>
</ul><br>
<br>
<b>Example Projects:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Self-Drive:</b> an autonomous vehicle project</li>
<li><b>Net-Zero-Surrey:</b> designing a sustainable transportation solution for more livable future cities</li>
<li><b>Urban Agriculture:</b> enabling the urban community to produce their own food</li>
<li><b>Robotics Arms:</b> modeling human motion with robotics arms</li>
<li><b>Drones:</b> sling load and cooperative drones</li>
</ul>
